## What is a RAT?
* A Remote Access Tool is a piece of software used to remotely access or control a computer. This tool can be used legitimately by system administrators for accessing the client computers.
* It is a preferred method of Administration over SSH due to the ability to use custom binaries and configurable connections.
* Python was chosen as both developers wish to expand knowledge in the language as well as network based scripting and tools.
